Due to html5 limitations, mkv are not playable. only mp4 torrents will work (popcorn time itself pulls only torrents with mp4 in them).

installation:

1. create a folder named "plugins".
2. put the contents of this plugin inside.

3. in popcorn time's index.html, add the following lines just before the "&lt;/body>" tag (at the end of the file):
	
	&lt;script src="plugins/anyfile/js/anyfile.js"></script>
	&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="plugins/anyfile/css/anyfile.css">

That's it :)
